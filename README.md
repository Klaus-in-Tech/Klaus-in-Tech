### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


You are welcome to my world ðŸ‘‹

I am Kakooza Allan Klaus from Uganda in Africa.

I am very passionate about Software automation, got to know about it 2 years ago but am positive it is the career that I'll be taking it on for the most part of my life since am seeing it's value in real time.

I have hands on experience with the UiPath platform and I've delivered a number of projects which include Invoicing Bot, Commission Bot, Reconcilation Bot and Extraction Bot using the REFramework for UiPath and SpringBoot.

I like learning and upskilling myself with the latest trends in the software automation space.

Currently agding Python to my toolbox since my goal is intelligent automation.

I also like connecting with people that share the same niche with me.
